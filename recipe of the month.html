            Karađorđe's schnitzel (Serbian: Карађорђева шницла/Karađorđeva šnicla) is a Serbian breaded cutlet dish
            named after the Serbian revolutionary Karađorđe. It is a rolled veal or pork steak, stuffed with kajmak, and
            then breaded and fried. It is served with roasted potatoes and tartar sauce.

            The steak is sometimes colloquially referred to as the maidens' dream (девојачки сан/devojački san),[1]
            because of its phallic shape.[1][2]

            The dish is a modern invention, created by chef Mića Stojanović in 1959[2] who, when he needed to prepare
            Chicken Kiev for a distinguished visitor from the Soviet Union, was faced with lack of poultry. He used veal
            instead of chicken.[2] However, not fully satisfied with the result, he poured tartar sauce over it, and
            decorated it with a slice of lemon and pieces of tomato, which at the end resembled the medal of the Order
            of the Star of Karađorđe, and thus the steak was named.[2]
